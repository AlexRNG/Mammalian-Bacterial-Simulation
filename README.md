# Mammalian-Bacterial-Simulation
For my A-Level Computer Science course I had a coursework project in which I was to deliver a product for a specified end-user. In this case, the end-user was Dr Tracy Nevitt of Neem Biotech.

The product I was asked to deliver a rudamentary system that simulates an exponential bacterial growth among mammalian cells, 
### Objectives

- The user was expected to be able to enter the starting conditions and virulence of the bacteria involved.

 - The simulation was to involve some randomness in particle movement as to replicate brownian motion at such small scales, to try and replicate this I chose to give each cell a random position and velocity on start up. 

### How it was Made
I created this program with the help of unity as it gave me the tools necessary to create an agent based simulation like this. download the docx of the documentation to see an in depth breakdown
